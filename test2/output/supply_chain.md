**Supply Chain Smart Contract Documentation**\n\nThis smart contract enables users to register, verify, receive, and check the status of products in a supply chain. The contract works with four actors: supplier, distributor, retailer, and consumer, and an auditor can also access and verify the data. \n\nFunctions:\n\n"+ "1. `register(string memory productId, string memory name, string memory description, uint quantity, uint latitude, uint longitude, uint expirationDate) public`: This function allows a supplier to register a new product. Requires the product ID, product name, product description, the quantity of the product, its latitude, longitude, and expiration date. \n\n"+ "2. `verify(string memory productId, uint256 productState) public`: This function allows a distributor, retailer, or auditor to verify a product. It requires the product ID and the updated product state. \n\n"+ "3. `receive(string memory productId) public`: This function allows a distributor to receive a product. It requires the product ID. \n\n"+ "4. `check(address user, string memory productId, uint256 productState) public view returns (bool)`: This function allows an actor in the supply chain to check a product's status. It requires the actor's Ethereum address, the product ID, and the product state to check. \n\n"+ "Variables, Enums, and Structs:\n\n"+ "- `ProductState`: An enumeration that represents the state of a product in the supply chain, includes the following states: `Registered`, `Received`, and `Verified`. \n\n"+ "- `Actor`: An enumeration that represents the actors involved in the supply chain, includes the following actors: `Supplier`, `Distributor`, `Retailer`, `Consumer`, and `Auditor`. \n\n"+ "- `Product`: A struct that stores information about a product, includes the following attributes: `supplier`, `actor`, `name`, `description`, `quantity`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `expirationDate`, and `productState`. \n\n"+ "- `mapping (string => Product) products`: a mapping that stores each registered product ID and its corresponding product details" } } }
